# QA Bugs

## QA-WEB-BLOCKER-001 â€” High â€” Browser automation outage blocked full 3-pass interactive QA
- **Area**: End-to-end booking flow validation at `https://kevinbarbershopwebsite.vercel.app/`
- **Repro steps**:
  1. Start interactive QA run.
  2. Attempt to continue browser-driven test after loading booking step.
- **Expected**: Browser session remains available to complete all 3 requested passes.
- **Actual**: Browser tool call fails with timeout: `Can't reach the OpenClaw browser control service (timed out after 20000ms)` and advises gateway restart.
- **Impact**: Could not complete all three full interactive passes; only partial coverage completed before outage.
- **Status**: Open (blocker)

## QA-WEB-002 â€” High â€” Homepage shows online booking unavailable/no bookable services
- **Area**: Public booking flow content/state on homepage booking section
- **Repro steps**:
  1. Fetch homepage content (`https://kevinbarbershopwebsite.vercel.app/`) during this run.
  2. Inspect booking section text.
- **Expected**: At least one bookable service/slot path should be available for online booking.
- **Actual**: Page displays `Online booking is temporarily unavailable.` and `We currently have no bookable services online.`
- **Impact**: Users cannot complete online booking.
- **Evidence**: Reproduced across repeated homepage checks in this run.
- **Status**: Open

## QA-WEB-003 â€” High â€” Inconsistent booking availability state across render paths
- **Area**: Homepage booking section / booking flow state consistency
- **Repro steps**:
  1. Open site interactively and click `Find available slots` in booking wizard.
  2. Observe Step 2 renders many slots (`299 found in next 7 days`).
  3. Separately fetch homepage content in non-interactive request path and observe messaging.
- **Expected**: Booking availability messaging should be consistent across render/request contexts.
- **Actual**: Interactive flow shows many available slots, while non-interactive content states `Online booking is temporarily unavailable` and `no bookable services online`.
- **Impact**: Users and monitoring tools can receive contradictory booking availability status.
- **Status**: Open

## QA-WEB-004 â€” Medium â€” Barber preference availability message conflicts with selectable barber options
- **Area**: Homepage barber preference content/state
- **Repro steps**:
  1. Open `https://kevinbarbershopwebsite.vercel.app/` in interactive browser run.
  2. Observe barber dropdown contains specific options (`Kevin`, `Mario`).
  3. In separate fetch/readability render path, observe text: `No specific barbers are currently available online. We'll book you with any available barber.`
- **Expected**: Availability message should match actual selectable options.
- **Actual**: Message says no specific barbers are available while specific barbers are selectable in UI.
- **Impact**: Users may assume barber selection is disabled when it is actually available.
- **Status**: Open

## QA-WEB-BLOCKER-002 â€” High â€” Vercel Security Checkpoint blocks automated QA access (HTTP 403)
- **Area**: Site accessibility for automated/browser-assisted QA
- **Repro steps**:
  1. Open `https://kevinbarbershopwebsite.vercel.app/` in browser automation.
  2. Observe page content: `We're verifying your browser` (Vercel Security Checkpoint).
  3. Fetch homepage via `web_fetch` (multiple attempts with cache-busting query params).
- **Expected**: QA tooling can load public homepage/booking content for regression checks.
- **Actual**: Requests are blocked by Vercel checkpoint; fetch returns `403` and browser shows verification interstitial.
- **Impact**: Full website QA pass cannot proceed beyond security checkpoint until allowlist/challenge bypass is configured.
- **Status**: Open (blocker)

## QA-WEB-005 â€” High â€” Booking Step 2 intermittently fails to load availability (JSON parse error from HTML response)
- **Area**: Booking wizard Step 2 availability loader
- **Repro steps**:
  1. Open `https://kevinbarbershopwebsite.vercel.app/` and go to Book an Appointment.
  2. Click `Find available slots`.
  3. Observe Step 2 error state. Click `Back to service & barber`, then `Find available slots` again.
  4. Click `Retry loading slots`.
- **Expected**: Slot API returns valid JSON and Step 2 displays available time slots.
- **Actual**: Step 2 shows `Availability failed to load` with details `Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON` and cannot continue.
- **Impact**: Customers cannot proceed past availability selection; online booking flow is blocked intermittently/fully depending on backend response.
- **Status**: Open

## QA-WEB-006 â€” High â€” End-to-end booking validation blocked by browser control timeout at Step 2â†’Step 3 transition
- **Area**: Live booking flow (`/?staffId=stf_kevin#book`) end-to-end completion
- **Repro steps**:
  1. Open `https://kevinbarbershopwebsite.vercel.app/?staffId=stf_kevin#book`.
  2. In Step 1, keep `Classic Haircut` and `Preferred barber: Kevin`, then click `Find available slots`.
  3. In Step 2, select `Earliest available` slot (`Feb 20, 2026, 9:30 AM`, Kevin).
  4. Click `Continue` to proceed to Step 3 (Contact).
- **Expected**: Flow advances to Step 3 and allows contact details entry so booking can be completed.
- **Actual**: Browser control call timed out exactly on the `Continue` action with: `Can't reach the OpenClaw browser control service (timed out after 20000ms)`. End-to-end booking could not be completed in this run.
- **Evidence**:
  - URL: `https://kevinbarbershopwebsite.vercel.app/?staffId=stf_kevin#book`
  - Observed at: 2026-02-19 ~16:10 PT
  - Pre-failure state confirmed: Step 2 loaded with `144 found in next 7 days`, slot selected.
  - Tool/network observation: control-plane timeout prevented completion; browser tool explicitly advised gateway/browser service restart.
- **Security impact**: **Low** direct security risk; primary impact is QA reliability and release confidence. Indirect risk: unstable tooling can mask real production defects by reducing deterministic regression coverage.
- **Status**: Open

## Partial run observations before blocker
- Initial interactive pass reached Step 2 and slot list rendered.
- Browser control has been intermittently unstable across runs.
- Additional non-interactive checks showed booking-unavailable messaging on homepage.

LAST_TICKET_ID: QA-WEB-006
NEW_IDS_ADDED: NONE
COVERAGE_EVIDENCE:
- Manual/automation repro on `/?staffId=stf_kevin#book`:
  - Step 1 -> Step 2 loads successfully (`144 found in next 7 days` in interactive browser).
  - Selecting first slot works.
  - Continue action reproduced OpenClaw browser-control timeout (`timed out after 20000ms`) at transition boundary.
- Independent request-path check (`web_fetch`) returns HTTP 200 and booking homepage content, confirming app availability while control-plane can still fail.
ROOT_CAUSE_TRIAGE:
- Primary: browser-control/control-plane instability (QA-WEB-006) rather than deterministic booking app logic defect.
- Secondary app-hardening gap found (QA-WEB-005 signature class): Step-2 availability loader assumed JSON and surfaced parser failures when backend/challenge returned HTML.
IMPLEMENTATION (Sen):
- Updated `src/components/templates/Scheduler.tsx`:
  - Added safe response parser for availability requests (`parseJsonSafely`).
  - Added explicit fallback messaging for non-JSON 403/5xx responses.
  - Preserved compatibility with existing mocked `fetch().json()` test flows.
- Added regression test (Sen):
  - `src/components/templates/Scheduler.test.tsx`
  - `maps non-JSON 403 availability responses to a safe user-facing message`
VALIDATION:
- `npx jest src/components/templates/Scheduler.test.tsx -t "maps non-JSON 403 availability responses"` PASS
- `npm run typecheck` PASS
NEXT_STEPS:
- Continue investigation for QA-WEB-006 by stabilizing browser-control layer (gateway/browser service health) and rerun full E2E booking from Step 2 -> Step 5 once control-plane is stable.

## QA-WEB-AH-001 - High - AUTOMATION-HEALTH: Browser relay attached-tab control-plane failure blocks mandatory E2E booking smoke
- **Category**: AUTOMATION-HEALTH (control-plane, not app-logic)
- **Area**: OpenClaw browser control / Chrome extension relay for /?staffId=stf_kevin#book
- **Repro steps**:
  1. Start browser session and open https://kevinbarbershopwebsite.vercel.app/?staffId=stf_kevin#book.
  2. Request page snapshot to begin E2E actions.
- **Expected**: Snapshot returns DOM refs so E2E booking steps can proceed.
- **Actual**: Browser tool fails before E2E interaction with error signature: Chrome extension relay is running, but no tab is connected. Click the OpenClaw Chrome extension icon on a tab to attach it (profile "chrome").
- **Impact**: Mandatory real-browser E2E booking smoke cannot be completed; run must be treated as blocked/failed coverage.
- **Failure domain**: control-plane
- **Status**: Open

## QA-WEB-007 — High — Final booking confirmation intermittently fails with `Unable to create booking at this time`
- **Area**: Booking API final confirm path (`POST /api/v1/bookings`)
- **Repro steps**:
  1. Complete booking flow through Step 4 and submit confirmation.
  2. Observe generic error banner: `Unable to create booking at this time`.
- **Expected**: Booking confirm returns `201` with booking id/access token.
- **Actual**: API can return `500 INTERNAL_ERROR` with generic message even when upstream booking input is valid.
- **Root cause**:
  - `logBookingLegalConsent()` write could fail on environments missing `booking_legal_consents` migration table.
  - That post-booking write failure bubbles as 500 and surfaces generic confirm error.
- **Fix (Sen)**:
  - Added self-healing schema fallback in `src/features/bookings/repository.ts`:
    - Detect missing `booking_legal_consents` table error.
    - Create table + index on demand.
    - Retry legal-consent insert.
- **Status**: Closed (2026-02-20)
- **Verification**:
  - Added regression test `src/features/bookings/repository.legalConsent.test.ts`.
  - Booking API and hold tests remain passing.

FAILURE_DOMAIN: control-plane (false-negative timeout on action ack)
COVERAGE_EVIDENCE: Reproduced Step2 Continue timeout signature (`Can't reach the OpenClaw browser control service (timed out after 20000ms)`) twice while driving /?staffId=stf_kevin#book with browser actions. In both cases, immediate same-target snapshot showed flow had already advanced to Step3 contact form. Confirms automation/control-plane response timeout rather than booking UI/app failure.
MITIGATION_NOTES: Use one tab targetId end-to-end, snapshot before critical actions, and on timeout verify state with same-target snapshot before declaring failure. See docs/openclaw-step2-timeout-runbook.md.
